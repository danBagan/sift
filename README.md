## 🎨 Neo-Brutalist Design Philosophy

Sift is intentionally opinionated. The interface follows **Neo-Brutalist design principles**:

- ⬛ **High contrast & bold color blocks**
- 🟥 **Sharp edges and visible borders**
- 🔤 **Strong, expressive typography**
- 🧱 **Functional, grid-based layouts**
- ❌ **No excessive shadows, gradients, or animations**

The result is a UI that feels **raw, confident, and honest**, while staying highly usable for daily task management.
