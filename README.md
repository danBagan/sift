## ✨ The Premise

Tired of feature bloat, complex pricing tiers, and interfaces that try too hard? **[Project Name]** is your antidote.

This is a lightweight, high-performance desktop application designed for task and project management, inspired by the utility of Trello but stripped down to the essentials.

We embrace a **Neo-Brutalist** design ethos—focusing on clarity, strong typography, deliberate use of color, and minimal visual embellishment—to deliver an interface that is honest, fast, and intensely usable.

**The best part? It's 100% FREE. No hidden costs, no premium features, just pure task management.**
